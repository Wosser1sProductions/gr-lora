gr-lora [![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rpp0/gr-lora.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rpp0/gr-lora)
=======

The gr-lora project aims to provide a collection of GNURadio blocks for receiving LoRa modulated radio messages using Software Defined Radio (SDR). More information about LoRa itself can be found on [the website of the LoRa Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org/).

Features
--------

Though there is no official reference implementation of LoRa, the protocol is described in various patents and blog posts (for a good resource, see [this RevSpace page](https://revspace.nl/DecodingLora)). The following features are fully supported by gr-lora:

- Synchronizing to LoRa frames transmitted with any spreading factor
- Deinterleaving
- Dewhitening
- Decoding + Hamming error correction of the LoRa PHDR length field
- Decoding + Hamming error correction of frame payloads (all coding rates)

Not supported yet:

- CRC checks of the payload and header
- Decoding multiple channels simultaneously
- Clock drift correction for very long frames

This feature set is enough for basic, experimental usage with SDRs.


Installation
------------

The installation procedure is the same as for any GNURadio OOT module:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../  # Note to Arch Linux users: add "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr"
make && sudo make install
```

The following dependencies are required:
- numpy
- scipy
- [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp)


Testing
-------

To test your installation, you can download one of the sample LoRa signals at [rpp0/gr-lora-samples](https://github.com/rpp0/gr-lora-samples). Configure ```apps/lora_receive_file.py``` to use the sample and run the script. You should see the decoded sample data:

```
$ ./lora_receive_file.py

Bits per symbol: 7
Bins per symbol: 128
Header bins per symbol: 32
Samples per symbol: 1024

```

Alternatively, if you have a LoRa transmitter, you can configure/modify  ```/examples/_examplify.py``` to generate example files and add them to ```/examples/qa_BasicTest_Data.xml``` to run them automatically with ```python/qa_BasicTest_XML.py``` (```xmltodict``` module needed).
Note that this script should be run with its shell script in ```build/python```.
This is to ensure compatibility with ```make test```.


Contributing
------------

Contributions to the project are very much appreciated! If you have an idea for improvement or noticed a bug, feel free to submit an issue. If you're up for the challenge and would like to introduce a feature yourself, we kindly invite you to submit a pull request.


Hardware
--------

Primarily, gr-lora was developed using a USRP and RN2483 LoRa chip. The following LoRa modules and SDRs were also tested and work with gr-lora:

Transmitters: Pycom LoPy, Dragino LoRa Raspberry Pi HAT, Adafruit Feather 32u4, Microchip RN 2483 (custom board)
Receivers: HackRF One, USRP B201, RTL-SDR


Usage
-----
